# sales_projection_SARIMAX_model
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a sales forecasting model using the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors) time series model. The primary goal is to accurately predict future sales based on historical data.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and exploration
SARIMAX model implementation and tuning
Model evaluation and performance metrics
Visualization of results
Acknowledgements:
A significant portion of the knowledge and methodology used in this project was derived from the YouTube channel PythonTube. However, the code and model have been adapted and modified to suit the specific characteristics of the dataset used in this project.
